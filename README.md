How do I approach designing software?
when I'm assigned a software design project, I usually start by thoroughly analyzing the project requirements. This helps me get a clear picture of what I'm supposed to create. Then, I break down the project into smaller, manageable components and categorize them for easier workload distribution. Once I have everything organized, I dive into the actual development of the components. This approach has been quite effective for me throughout my time in college.

How do I approach developing programs?
When it comes to the actual development of software, my approach is to first create a basic, functional version of the program, often referred to as a minimum viable product (MVP). I use this MVP to demonstrate the concept to my professor or peers and to start a feedback loop for making the program as user-friendly as possible. The rest of my development time is spent in iterative cycles of development and feedback.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
As a college student, computer science has been instrumental in helping me reach my goals. Not only does it provide me with a fascinating and enjoyable subject to study, but it also offers promising career opportunities. Since I started studying computer science, I've found that I genuinely enjoy waking up and going to class each day. It has made my college experience both rewarding and enjoyable.
